Cgl0004I processed model has 1897 rows, 651 columns (651 integer (625 of which binary)) and 6362 elements
Cutoff increment increased from 1e-05 to 0.9999
Cbc0045I 1 integer variables out of 651 objects (651 integer) have cost of 1 - high priority
Cbc0045I branch on satisfied Y create fake objective Y random cost Y
Cbc0038I Initial state - 301 integers unsatisfied sum - 75.6726
Cbc0038I Pass   1: suminf.    0.00000 (0) obj. 35840 iterations 862
Cbc0038I Solution found of 35840
Cbc0038I Cleaned solution of 35840
Cbc0038I Before mini branch and bound, 349 integers at bound fixed and 0 continuous
Cbc0038I Full problem 1897 rows 651 columns, reduced to 1163 rows 302 columns - 7 fixed gives 1039, 262 - still too large
Cbc0038I Mini branch and bound did not improve solution (0.32 seconds)
Cbc0038I Round again with cutoff of 35019.9
