Cbc0038I No solution found this major pass
Cbc0038I Before mini branch and bound, 4 integers at bound fixed and 0 continuous
Cbc0038I Full problem 203 rows 76 columns, reduced to 194 rows 72 columns - 9 fixed gives 169, 58 - still too large
Cbc0038I Mini branch and bound did not improve solution (0.25 seconds)
Cbc0038I After 0.25 seconds - Feasibility pump exiting with objective of 18432 - took 0.24 seconds
Cbc0012I Integer solution of 18432 found by feasibility pump after 0 iterations and 0 nodes (0.25 seconds)
Cbc0038I Full problem 203 rows 76 columns, reduced to 157 rows 54 columns - 7 fixed gives 121, 38 - ok now
Cbc0006I The LP relaxation is infeasible or too expensive
Cbc0013I At root node, 0 cuts changed objective from 17408 to 17408 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Probing) - 1 row cuts average 0.0 elements, 8 column cuts (8 active)  in 0.000 seconds - new frequency is 1
