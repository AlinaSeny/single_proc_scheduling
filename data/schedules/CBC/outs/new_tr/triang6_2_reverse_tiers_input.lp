Cbc0038I No solution found this major pass
Cbc0038I Before mini branch and bound, 36 integers at bound fixed and 0 continuous
Cbc0038I Full problem 765 rows 276 columns, reduced to 691 rows 239 columns - 32 fixed gives 437, 138 - still too large
Cbc0038I Mini branch and bound did not improve solution (0.61 seconds)
Cbc0038I After 0.61 seconds - Feasibility pump exiting with objective of 284 - took 0.52 seconds
Cbc0012I Integer solution of 284 found by feasibility pump after 0 iterations and 0 nodes (0.61 seconds)
Cbc0038I Full problem 765 rows 276 columns, reduced to 455 rows 126 columns - 24 fixed gives 289, 73 - ok now
Cbc0006I The LP relaxation is infeasible or too expensive
Cbc0013I At root node, 0 cuts changed objective from 268.3215 to 268.3215 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Probing) - 84 row cuts average 2.2 elements, 22 column cuts (22 active)  in 0.002 seconds - new frequency is 1
