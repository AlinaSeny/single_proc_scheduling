Cbc0038I No solution found this major pass
Cbc0038I Before mini branch and bound, 19 integers at bound fixed and 0 continuous
Cbc0038I Full problem 290 rows 108 columns, reduced to 253 rows 88 columns - 1 fixed gives 244, 85 - still too large
Cbc0038I Mini branch and bound did not improve solution (0.19 seconds)
Cbc0038I After 0.19 seconds - Feasibility pump exiting with objective of 20480 - took 0.17 seconds
Cbc0012I Integer solution of 20480 found by feasibility pump after 0 iterations and 0 nodes (0.19 seconds)
Cbc0038I Full problem 290 rows 108 columns, reduced to 191 rows 62 columns - 1 fixed gives 159, 57 - still too large
